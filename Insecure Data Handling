# OWASP Top 10 – Security Concepts & Practicals

## 1. Cryptographic Failures

### Definition
Cryptographic failures occur when sensitive data is not properly protected due to missing encryption, weak algorithms, or incorrect implementation.

### Common Causes
- Plaintext password storage
- Weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES)
- Hardcoded encryption keys
- Custom / homemade cryptography
- Insecure data transmission (no HTTPS)

### Prevention
- Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 for password hashing
- Use trusted encryption algorithms (AES, RSA)
- Never store secrets in source code
- Use secure secret management systems

### Practical
A vulnerable note-sharing service uses a weak shared derived key. The objective is to decrypt all notes and retrieve the flag.

## 2. Injection

### Definition
Injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted user input is directly passed to an interpreter such as a database, OS, or template engine.

### Types
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- Server Side Template Injection (SSTI)
- Prompt Injection

### SSTI Overview
SSTI occurs when user input is rendered directly inside server-side templates, allowing attackers to execute expressions or system commands.

### Prevention
- Use prepared statements for databases
- Avoid shell execution
- Escape and validate user input
- Never render raw user input in templates

### Practical
The lab demonstrates SSTI exploitation to retrieve a flag from the server.

## 3. Software & Data Integrity Failures

### Definition
These failures occur when applications trust code, updates, or data without verifying integrity or authenticity.

### Common Causes
- Unverified software updates
- Unsafe deserialization
- Compromised CI/CD pipelines
- Trusting external data sources

### Deserialization Risk
Unsafe deserialization (e.g., Python pickle) can lead to remote code execution.

### Prevention
- Never deserialize untrusted data
- Use safe formats like JSON
- Validate integrity using hashes and signatures
- Secure build and deployment pipelines

### Practical
The lab demonstrates a Python deserialization attack using malicious input to retrieve a flag.

## Conclusion
OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities remain relevant due to insecure coding practices. Proper input handling, cryptographic hygiene, and integrity verification are critical to building secure applications.
